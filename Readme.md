Homotopy Type Theory
====================

Proving some propositions from the [HOTT book](https://github.com/HoTT/book). A help to read along 

   - *Equality.idr* : defining base path induction and simple properties of equality types
   - *Homotopy.idr* : defining homotopies between functions, building towards function extensionality theorem
   - *TypeEquicalance.idr* : defining type equivalence and stating the univalence axiom
   - *Natural.idr* : using natural numbers as a test ground
